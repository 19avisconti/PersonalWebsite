# Project 1, Milestone 2: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Example Website CSS Property Analysis

> Explain why you chose the example website and how you plan to use it as inspiration for styling your personal website.

Which example website did you choose (1 sentence)
I want to choose the first website I listed as my inspiration for my personal website.

Why did you choose this example website? How do you plan to use it as inspiration for styling your personal website? (1-2 sentences)

I chose this example website because it is the most aesthetically pleasing to me. I like how this website has a sidebar and how the sidebar has a colored background.
