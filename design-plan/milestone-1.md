[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Website Topic
> Briefly explain what your website will be about. Share your vision of your personal website. (1 sentence)

My website will be about the best places to eat around Monmouth County in New Jersey.


## Personal Website Design Exploration

Identify two personal websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; **please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create**. You may not use the instructor's website or template websites for this part; the example websites should be real personal websites that exist on the web.

Include a **mobile** screenshot of the home page for each site. (If you're taking a screenshot on your laptop, resize your browser window to a mobile size before taking the screenshot.)

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

My audience is a cohesive group of people with uniform goals because every single person who views my website wants to know more about me. This group of people can include recruiters, interviewers, but also other groups of people like my friends and people I meet.
