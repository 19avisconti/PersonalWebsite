# Project 1: Design Journey

For each milestone, complete only the design journey file for that milestone.

If you need to revise your design/plan, please revise the plan in the original milestone file.
When updating, do **not** delete your original plan. Leave your original plan in place and append to it. Place your new plan _below_ the original and then explain why you are changing your plan.


AFTER MILESTONE 1 FEEDBACK:
I added more content to my website, and I also adjusted the files in the project1 directory. I cited the website images correctly, and found two new websites to take inspiration off.


AFTER MILESTONE 2 FEEDBACK:
I only got points taken off in my milestone 2 submission for lisitng 'width' and 'height' as CSS properties during my analysis for the 2 example websites. I understand now that 'width' and 'height' are not treated as CSS in the same way something like a border would be.
