        <h2>Sports</h2>

        <p>
          Here are some sports that I like to play:
        </p>

        <h3>Pickleball</h3>

        <img src="images/pickleball.jpg" alt="Image of people playing pickleball." class="pickleball">

        <p>
          Playing pickleball is a sport I thoroughly enjoy. The game’s fast pace and the blend of elements from tennis, badminton, and table tennis make it both exciting and accessible. I appreciate the social aspect of pickleball, as it’s a wonderful way to connect with friends and meet new people while staying active. The strategic elements and quick reflexes required for volleys and dinks keep the game engaging and fun. Whether in a competitive match or a casual game, pickleball always offers a great time and a solid workout.
        </p>

        <h3>Fencing</h3>

        <p>
          I have developed a passion for fencing, which I find both exhilarating and intellectually stimulating. The sport merges physical agility with strategic thinking, making each bout a dynamic and engaging challenge. I enjoy the precision required in fencing, from perfecting various techniques and footwork to anticipating and countering an opponent’s moves. The combination of athleticism and mental sharpness keeps me motivated and constantly improving. The sense of accomplishment that comes with each successful maneuver and victory makes fencing a rewarding pursuit that I deeply enjoy.
